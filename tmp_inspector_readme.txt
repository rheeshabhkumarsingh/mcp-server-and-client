# MCP Inspector

The MCP inspector is a developer tool for testing and debugging MCP servers.

## Architecture Overview

The MCP Inspector consists of two main components that work together:

- **MCP Inspector Client (MCPI)**: A React-based web UI that provides an interactive interface for testing and debugging MCP servers
- **MCP Proxy (MCPP)**: A Node.js server that acts as a protocol bridge, connecting the web UI to MCP servers via various transport methods (stdio, SSE, streamable-http)

Note that the proxy is not a network proxy for intercepting traffic. Instead, it functions as both an MCP client (connecting to your MCP server) and an HTTP server (serving the web UI), enabling browser-based interaction with MCP servers that use different transport protocols.

## Running the Inspector

### Requirements

- Node.js: ^22.7.5

### Quick Start (UI mode)

To get up and running right away with the UI, just execute the following:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
```

The server will start up and the UI will be accessible at `http://localhost:6274`.

### Docker Container

You can also start it in a Docker container with the following command:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -p 127.0.0.1:6274:6274 \
  -p 127.0.0.1:6277:6277 \
  -e HOST=0.0.0.0 \
  -e MCP_AUTO_OPEN_ENABLED=false \
  ghcr.io/modelcontextprotocol/inspector:latest
```

### From an MCP server repository

To inspect an MCP server implementation, there's no need to clone this repo. Instead, use `npx`. For example, if your server is built at `build/index.js`:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node build/index.js
```

You can pass both arguments and environment variables to your MCP server. Arguments are passed directly to your server, while environment variables can be set using the `-e` flag:

```bash
# Pass arguments only
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node build/index.js arg1 arg2

# Pass environment variables only
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector -e key=value -e key2=$VALUE2 node build/index.js

# Pass both environment variables and arguments
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector -e key=value -e key2=$VALUE2 node build/index.js arg1 arg2

# Use -- to separate inspector flags from server arguments
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector -e key=$VALUE -- node build/index.js -e server-flag
```

The inspector runs both an MCP Inspector (MCPI) client UI (default port 6274) and an MCP Proxy (MCPP) server (default port 6277). Open the MCPI client UI in your browser to use the inspector. (These ports are derived from the T9 dialpad mapping of MCPI and MCPP respectively, as a mnemonic). You can customize the ports if needed:

```bash
CLIENT_PORT=8080 SERVER_PORT=9000 npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node build/index.js
```

For more details on ways to use the inspector, see the [Inspector section of the MCP docs site](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector). For help with debugging, see the [Debugging guide](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/debugging).

### Servers File Export

The MCP Inspector provides convenient buttons to export server launch configurations for use in clients such as Cursor, Claude Code, or the Inspector's CLI. The file is usually called `mcp.json`.

- **Server Entry** - Copies a single server configuration entry to your clipboard. This can be added to your `mcp.json` file inside the `mcpServers` object with your preferred server name.

  **STDIO transport example:**

  ```json
  {
    "command": "node",
    "args": ["build/index.js", "--debug"],
    "env": {
      "API_KEY": "your-api-key",
      "DEBUG": "true"
    }
  }
  ```

  **SSE transport example:**

  ```json
  {
    "type": "sse",
    "url": "http://localhost:3000/events",
    "note": "For SSE connections, add this URL directly in Client"
  }
  ```

  **Streamable HTTP transport example:**

  ```json
  {
    "type": "streamable-http",
    "url": "http://localhost:3000/mcp",
    "note": "For Streamable HTTP connections, add this URL directly in your MCP Client"
  }
  ```

- **Servers File** - Copies a complete MCP configuration file structure to your clipboard, with your current server configuration added as `default-server`. This can be saved directly as `mcp.json`.

  **STDIO transport example:**

  ```json
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "default-server": {
        "command": "node",
        "args": ["build/index.js", "--debug"],
        "env": {
          "API_KEY": "your-api-key",
          "DEBUG": "true"
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  **SSE transport example:**

  ```json
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "default-server": {
        "type": "sse",
        "url": "http://localhost:3000/events",
        "note": "For SSE connections, add this URL directly in Client"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  **Streamable HTTP transport example:**

  ```json
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "default-server": {
        "type": "streamable-http",
        "url": "http://localhost:3000/mcp",
        "note": "For Streamable HTTP connections, add this URL directly in your MCP Client"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

These buttons appear in the Inspector UI after you've configured your server settings, making it easy to save and reuse your configurations.

For SSE and Streamable HTTP transport connections, the Inspector provides similar functionality for both buttons. The "Server Entry" button copies the configuration that can be added to your existing configuration file, while the "Servers File" button creates a complete configuration file containing the URL for direct use in clients.

You can paste the Server Entry into your existing `mcp.json` file under your chosen server name, or use the complete Servers File payload to create a new configuration file.

### Authentication

The inspector supports bearer token authentication for SSE connections. Enter your token in the UI when connecting to an MCP server, and it will be sent in the Authorization header. You can override the header name using the input field in the sidebar.

### Security Considerations

The MCP Inspector includes a proxy server that can run and communicate with local MCP processes. The proxy server should not be exposed to untrusted networks as it has permissions to spawn local processes and can connect to any specified MCP server.

#### Authentication

The MCP Inspector proxy server requires authentication by default. When starting the server, a random session token is generated and printed to the console:

```
ðŸ”‘ Session token: 3a1c267fad21f7150b7d624c160b7f09b0b8c4f623c7107bbf13378f051538d4

ðŸ”— Open inspector with token pre-filled:
   http://localhost:6274/?MCP_PROXY_AUTH_TOKEN=3a1c267fad21f7150b7d624c160b7f09b0b8c4f623c7107bbf13378f051538d4
```

This token must be included as a Bearer token in the Authorization header for all requests to the server. The inspector will automatically open your browser with the token pre-filled in the URL.

**Automatic browser opening** - The inspector now automatically opens your browser with the token pre-filled in the URL when authentication is enabled.

**Alternative: Manual configuration** - If you already have the inspector open:

1. Click the "Configuration" button in the sidebar
2. Find "Proxy Session Token" and enter the token displayed in the proxy console
3. Click "Save" to apply the configuration

The token will be saved in your browser's local storage for future use.

If you need to disable authentication (NOT RECOMMENDED), you can set the `DANGEROUSLY_OMIT_AUTH` environment variable:

```bash
DANGEROUSLY_OMIT_AUTH=true npm start
```

**ðŸš¨ WARNING ðŸš¨**

Disabling authentication with `DANGEROUSLY_OMIT_AUTH` is incredibly dangerous! Disabling auth leaves your machine open to attack not just when exposed to the public internet, but also **via your web browser**. Meaning, visiting a malicious website OR viewing a malicious advertizement could allow an attacker to remotely compromise your computer. Do not disable this feature unless you truly understand the risks.

Read more about the risks of this vulnerability on Oligo's blog: [Critical RCE Vulnerability in Anthropic MCP Inspector - CVE-2025-49596](https://www.oligo.security/blog/critical-rce-vulnerability-in-anthropic-mcp-inspector-cve-2025-49596)

---

You can also set the token via the `MCP_PROXY_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable when starting the server:

```bash
MCP_PROXY_AUTH_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 32) npm start
```

#### Local-only Binding

By default, both the MCP Inspector proxy server and client bind only to `localhost` to prevent network access. This ensures they are not accessible from other devices on the network. If you need to bind to all interfaces for development purposes, you can override this with the `HOST` environment variable:

```bash
HOST=0.0.0.0 npm start
```

**Warning:** Only bind to all interfaces in trusted network environments, as this exposes the proxy server's ability to execute local processes and both services to network access.

#### DNS Rebinding Protection

To prevent DNS rebinding attacks, the MCP Inspector validates the `Origin` header on incoming requests. By default, only requests from the client origin are allowed (respects `CLIENT_PORT` if set, defaulting to port 6274). You can configure additional allowed origins by setting the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable (comma-separated list):

```bash
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:6274,http://localhost:8000 npm start
```
